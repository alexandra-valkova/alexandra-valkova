# Hello 👋🏻 Bonjour 🇫🇷 Здравейте 🇧🇬

## Who am I and where do I come from? 🌍

My name is Alexandra 👱🏻‍♀️ I am half French 🇫🇷 and half Bulgarian 🇧🇬 I was born in France and grew up bilingual.

I am currently based in **Nice** 📍 on the sunny French Riviera seaside and close to the [Sophia-Antipolis](https://www.sophia-antipolis.fr/en/) tech park.

## What have I studied so far? 🎓

After graduating with honours from a high school :school: specialising in mathematics and informatics (my first programming languages were **C++** and **Visual Basic**) in Plovdiv, Bulgaria 🇧🇬 I enrolled at the *[University of Plovdiv](https://uni-plovdiv.academia.edu/alexandravalkova)* :classical_building: and completed my 4-year Bachelor's degree in **_Software Technology and Design_**, also with honours. During my final year 👩🏼‍🎓 I had the pleasure of teaching students [design patterns in **C#**](https://github.com/alexandra-valkova/DesignPatterns). At the same university, I continued my studies by attending a one-year Master's program in _Software Technology with Specialization in Mobile Systems and Applications_.

## Where have I worked so far? 👩🏼‍💻

Towards the end of my second year, I started an internship at [Prime Holding](https://github.com/Prime-Holding) 🇧🇬 This first experience taught me a lot, including working in a team, using the Scrum methodology and version control (**Git**). I acquired front-end (**HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS**), back-end (**ASP.NET MVC**, **Entity Framework** with **SQL Server**, **APIs**) and mobile dev (**Xamarin**) skills.

My next professional experience was at [ScaleFocus](https://github.com/scalefocus) 🇧🇬 where I worked on several different client projects, most of them in _English_. I had the opportunity to further my knowledge in **.NET**, **TypeScript** and **SQL**. I also learned how to write unit tests (**NUnit**).

My first job in France was at [ALTEN](https://alten.com) 🇫🇷 where I had the chance to work with a French team for the first time. I was able to practice my _French_ like never before, complete a **.NET Core** course and broaden my knowledge of various technologies, tools and methodologies.

## What is my tech stack? 💻

I am most fluent in **C#** and the **.NET** platform. My skill set is mainly focused on the _back end_, but I'm open to expanding my _front-end_ skills as well. I've also had an interest in developing _mobile apps_ and have some experience with cross-platform development. My full stack is available at [StackShare](https://stackshare.io/alexandra-valkova) ⬇️
