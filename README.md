## Who am I and where I am from? 🌍

My name is Alexandra, I am half French 🇫🇷 and half Bulgarian 🇧🇬. I was born in France and grew up bilingual.

I am currently based in **Nice** 📍 on the sunny French Riviera seaside and close to the [Sophia-Antipolis](https://www.sophia-antipolis.fr/en/) tech park.

## What have I studied so far? 🎓

After graduating with honours from a high school :school: specialising in mathematics and informatics (my first programming languages were **C++** and **VisualBasic**) in Plovdiv, Bulgaria 🇧🇬 I enrolled at the *[University of Plovdiv](https://uni-plovdiv.academia.edu/alexandravalkova)* :classical_building: and completed my 4-year Bachelor's degree in **_Software Technology and Design_**, also with honours. During my final year 👩🏼‍🎓 I had the pleasure of teaching students [design patterns in **C#**](https://github.com/alexandra-valkova/DesignPatterns).

## Where have I worked so far? 👩🏼‍💻

Towards the end of my second year, I started an internship at [Prime Holding](https://github.com/Prime-Holding) 🇧🇬. This first experience taught me a lot, including working in a team, using the Scrum methodology and version control (**Git**). I became familiar with the MacOS operating system when I worked on a Mac for a short time.

My next professional experience was at [ScaleFocus](https://github.com/scalefocus) 🇧🇬 where I worked on several different projects, most of them in _English_. I had the opportunity to further my knowledge in **.NET**, **TypeScript** and **SQL**. I also learned how to write unit tests.

My first job in France was at [ALTEN](https://alten.com) 🇫🇷 where I had the chance to work with a French team for the first time. I was able to practice my _French_ like never before, complete a **.NET Core** course and dive deeper into **SQL**. Every couple of weeks I was assigned to work on the support side.

## What is my tech stack? 💻

I am most fluent in **C#** and the **.NET** platform. My skill set is mainly focused on the _back end_, but I'm open to expanding my _front-end_ skills as well. I'm also interested in developing _mobile apps_ and have some experience with cross-platform development such as **Xamarin**.

## Who am I aspiring to be? ✨

My main objectives are to deepen my knowledge, gain more relevant experience, develop my skills and increase my autonomy.

### Sustainable 🌱

In addition to this, I am curious about **Green IT**. I am interested in applying the principles of sustainable software development in my work, or being part of a team that does. For this reason, I have started this journey by completing the [**_Green Software for Practitioners_**](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/) course [:octocat:](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/learn) from [The Green Software Foundation](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation) and becoming certified [🏅](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131/) by [The Linux Foundation](https://github.com/linuxfoundation). I am eager to learn more and obtain additional certifications in the future, such as the ones issued by the [INR](https://institutnr.org/sustainable-it-certificate-of-knowledge) and [CNUMR](https://github.com/cnumr). I have also shelved some books about sustainable IT on [Goodreads 📚](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/41530588-alexandra-valkova?shelf=green-it) and have started adding relevant repositories to my [GitHub list :octocat:](https://github.com/stars/alexandra-valkova/lists/green-it)
